## Personal Learnings
This project proved the most difficult out of the ones I have done so far. Connecting pages through php and overwriting styling put up a challenge that helped me improve my coding experience immensely. Learning PHP syntax was difficult at first, but I am now able to read and put together pages using PHP.
